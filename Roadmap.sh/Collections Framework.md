The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly used data structures and algorithms. It is part of the standard Java library. All these classes and interfaces extend or implement the `Collection` interface, ensuring a standard structure for managing groups of objects. The framework heavily utilizes [[Generics]], allowing for type-safe operations on collections, which improves program safety and readability by reducing runtime errors related to type casting. This framework provides implementations of various data structures like lists, sets, and maps, offering a versatile toolset for handling data in Java applications.
